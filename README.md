# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple game of tic-tac-toe, based on an SPA, and utilizes an API to sign in, sign out, create games, and have a record of past games. 

I created this project for my Software Engineering boot camp with General Assembly.

In planning for this projects, I decided to set up the user api functionality first, followed by setting up the html. I continued on to implement the game logic and game api functionality, to finish this project I implemented CSS to style the page.

## Setup Steps
  1. Fork and clone this repository
  2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
  3. Use `grunt serve` to start up server.
